*test_sensor_RPi* is a project using a DHT-22 digital temperature 
and relative humidity sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi single-
chip computer. A crontab job is set up to fire a script written in 
Python (by AdaFruit) to obtain the data from the sensor. They can 
then be use as seen fit, for example logged to an SQLite database 
file.
